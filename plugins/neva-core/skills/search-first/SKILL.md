# /search-first: Research Before You Code

Systematizes the "search for existing solutions before implementing" workflow.

## Trigger

Use this skill when:
- Starting a new feature that likely has existing solutions
- Adding a dependency or integration
- The user asks "add X functionality" and you're about to write code
- Before creating a new utility, helper, or abstraction

## Workflow

## Three Layers of Knowledge

Know which layer you are operating in before you trust what you found (from gstack's "Search Before Building"):

| Layer | What it is | Risk | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Tried and true** | standard patterns, battle-tested approaches, deeply in distribution | assuming the obvious answer is right when occasionally it is not | check anyway; the cost is near zero, and questioning the obvious is sometimes where the best idea is |
| **2. New and popular** | current best practices, blog posts, ecosystem trends | the crowd can be as wrong about new things as about old ones | search for these, then scrutinize; results are inputs to your thinking, not answers |
| **3. First principles** | your own reasoning about this specific problem | none, if it follows from evidence | prize these above everything; they are what makes the result better than the obvious one |

**The eureka check.** The most valuable outcome of searching is not a solution to copy. It is: (1) understanding what everyone is doing and why (layers 1 and 2), (2) applying first-principles reasoning to their assumptions (layer 3), and (3) finding a clear reason the conventional approach is wrong for this case. When that happens, say so explicitly in the decision, and build the complete version of the right thing. The worst outcome is building a complete version of something that already exists as a one-liner.

## Decision Matrix

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Exact match, well-maintained, MIT/Apache | **Adopt**: install and use directly |
| Partial match, good foundation | **Extend**: install + write thin wrapper |
| Multiple weak matches | **Compose**: combine 2-3 small packages |
| Nothing suitable found | **Build**: write custom, but informed by research |

## How to Use

### Step 0: Tool Availability Preflight

This is agent guidance, not an executable setup script. Check only the channels
that are relevant to the task and project in front of you.

| Channel | Check | If missing |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Repository search | `rg --files` and targeted `rg` queries | State that only visible files were inspected |
| Package registry | `npm --version`, `python -m pip --version`, or project package manager | Use web/docs search and avoid claiming registry coverage |
| GitHub CLI | `gh auth status` | Use public web or local git history only |
| MCP/docs tools | Available tool list or local MCP config | Fall back to official docs/web search |
| Skills directory | `ls "$HOME/.claude/skills" "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache" "$HOME/.codex/skills"` where applicable | Say no local skill catalog was available |

### Quick Mode (inline)

Before writing a utility or adding functionality, mentally run through:

0. Does this already exist in the repo? → `rg` through relevant modules/tests first
1. Is this a common problem? → Search npm/PyPI
2. Is there an MCP for this? → Check `~/.claude/settings.json` and search
3. Is there a skill for this? → Check `$HOME/.claude/skills/` and installed plugins (the `skill-scout` skill does this thoroughly)
4. Is there a GitHub implementation/template? → Run GitHub code search for maintained OSS before writing net-new code

### Full Mode (agent)

For non-trivial functionality, launch the researcher agent:

```
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="
  Research existing tools for: [DESCRIPTION]
  Language/framework: [LANG]
  Constraints: [ANY]

  Search: npm/PyPI, MCP servers, Claude Code skills, GitHub
  Return: Structured comparison with recommendation
")
```

Older Claude Code docs may call this `Task(...)`; use the current agent/subagent
tool name exposed by the active harness.

## Search Shortcuts by Category

### Development Tooling
- Linting → `eslint`, `ruff`, `textlint`, `markdownlint`
- Formatting → `prettier`, `black`, `gofmt`
- Testing → `jest`, `pytest`, `go test`
- Pre-commit → `husky`, `lint-staged`, `pre-commit`

### AI/LLM Integration
- Claude SDK → Context7 for latest docs
- Prompt management → Check MCP servers
- Document processing → `unstructured`, `pdfplumber`, `mammoth`

### Data & APIs
- HTTP clients → `httpx` (Python), `ky`/`undici` (Node)
- Validation → `zod` (TS), `pydantic` (Python)
- Database → Check for MCP servers first

### Content & Publishing
- Markdown processing → `remark`, `unified`, `markdown-it`
- Image optimization → `sharp`, `imagemin`

## Integration Points

### With planner agent
The planner should invoke researcher before Phase 1 (Architecture Review):
- Researcher identifies available tools
- Planner incorporates them into the implementation plan
- Avoids "reinventing the wheel" in the plan

### With architect agent
The architect should consult researcher for:
- Technology stack decisions
- Integration pattern discovery
- Existing reference architectures

### With skill-scout skill
When the thing that may already exist is a skill, `skill-scout` runs the search, vetting, and ranking.

### With iterative-retrieval skill
Combine for progressive discovery:
- Cycle 1: Broad search (npm, PyPI, MCP)
- Cycle 2: Evaluate top candidates in detail
- Cycle 3: Test compatibility with project constraints

## Examples

### Example 1: "Add dead link checking"
```
Need: Check markdown files for broken links
Search: npm "markdown dead link checker"
Found: textlint-rule-no-dead-link (score: 9/10)
Action: ADOPT - npm install textlint-rule-no-dead-link
Result: Zero custom code, battle-tested solution
```

### Example 2: "Add HTTP client wrapper"
```
Need: Resilient HTTP client with retries and timeout handling
Search: npm "http client retry", PyPI "httpx retry"
Found: got (Node) with retry plugin, httpx (Python) with built-in retry
Action: ADOPT - use got/httpx directly with retry config
Result: Zero custom code, production-proven libraries
```

### Example 3: "Add config file linter"
```
Need: Validate project config files against a schema
Search: npm "config linter schema", "json schema validator cli"
Found: ajv-cli (score: 8/10)
Action: ADOPT + EXTEND - install ajv-cli, write project-specific schema
Result: 1 package + 1 schema file, no custom validation logic
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Jumping to code**: Writing a utility without checking if one exists
- **Ignoring MCP**: Not checking if an MCP server already provides the capability
- **Silent skipping**: Reporting "nothing found" when a search channel was unavailable
- **Over-customizing**: Wrapping a library so heavily it loses its benefits
- **Dependency bloat**: Installing a massive package for one small feature
